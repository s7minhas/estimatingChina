\begin_layout Abstract
While the inner dynamics of political elites are key to our understanding
 of political developments in authoritarian regimes, scholars have long
 found it difficult to collect and analyze relational data on how the circle
 of inner elites evolves over time.
 In this study, we focus on the public co-appearances of political elites
 in China, and introduce a latent network approach to exploring the shifts
 in their power-sharing dynamics.
 Specifically, we conceptualize public co-appearances as “foci,” around
 which various political activities are organized.
 Since elites’ engagement in these foci is highly selective, their co-appearance
s signal important information about elites’ collusion and cooptation.
 Relying on the latent network model and a unique database that tracks the
 appearances of over 200 leading Chinese officials, we systematically examine
 and compute elites' total appearances, dyadic coappearances, and finally
 their latent network distance.
 We test how well these three indicators fare in predicting elites' appointments
 in the leading small groups (LSGs) at the national level, i.e., Central Committee
 LSGs and State Council LSGs.
 Our analyses show that while elites' total appearance and their latent
 network distances are strongly associated with their LSG memberships, dyadic
 coappearance is much weaker in predicting LSG memberships.

However, de facto patterns and rules of elite competition and cooperation

 This common incongruity between formal institutions and informal rules

 Much of the scholarly inquiry has either been based on anecdotal and impression

In this article, we present a network approach to systematically mapping
 the power-sharing dynamics in nondemocratic regimes.
 As elites’ engagement in political events are highly selective and strictly
 orchestrated in authoritarian regimes like China, their co-appearances
 in public events signal important information about elites’ collusion and
 cooptation.
 Specifically, we distinguish and answer three critical questions: (1) who's
 in charge, (2) who's who, and (3) who are my allies.

 The question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

who's in charge
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 is of critical importance in authoritarian regimes like China where formal
 institutions are vulnerable to elites' influence.
 It helps reveal the actual power and influence of individual elites.
 Recently, scholars like 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 empirically explore this question by analyzing newspaper coverage of CCP
 elites 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Rather than focusing on individual elites, the question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who's who
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 points to dyadic relationship between a given pair of elites like collegial
 ties from the early career stage.
 Myriads of studies show that such factional ties are closely associated
 with important personnel appointment of the CCP party state 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

key "Meyer2016,Opper2015,Shih2010"

\end_inset

.
 However, a dyadic 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 approach falls short in revealing the potential indirect connections between
 elites.
 For instance, two elites can form a coalition without a direct dyadic tie
 between them but based on their connections to a common third elites.
 The question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who are my allies,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 therefore, tends to capture such indirect and high-dimensional interdependence
 between elites.
 Unfortunately, we find that no studies have examined such indirect relationship
s.
 Moreover, scholars adopt different approaches in answering the first two
 questions.
 We lack a systematic framework to understand and analyze elite dynamics
 in authoritarian regimes.

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we introduce a latent network network model

 LSGs, though not incorporated into charts of Party or government organs,
 play a pivotal role in communicating, coordinating, and implementing of
 important decisions across different segments and various levels of the
 governments.
 LSGs not only provide an institutional remedy to the regime's prolonged
 problem of political fragmentation, as shown by the development of the
 infamous Central Cultural Revolution Group (1966-69), LSGs can also serve
 as an effective vehicle for expansion of personal power 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Our analyses then show that while elites' total appearance

 Most excitingly though, the best predictor of LSG membership is our new
 measure of latent network proximity.
 This helps us, not only to predict the substantively important changes
 in policy leadership in China, but also confirms that this latent measure
 helps us to understand the shifting allegiances undergirding contemporary

Literature Review: Elites and Factional Ties

\begin_layout Standard
There has been a burgeoning literature on authoritarian politics.
 Extant research increasingly studies legislatures and elections, as well
 as information control and repression across dictatorships.
 However, as noted by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Svolik2008"

\end_inset

, a formidable challenge to integrate such a fragmented understanding of
 authoritarian politics is our underdeveloped empirical strategies to track
 and map elite dynamics.
 Our lack of a systematic approach significantly hinders our ability to
 identify key political actors, to locate the sources of intra-elite conflict,
 and thereby to explain the enormous variation in institutions, leaders,
 and policies across dictatorships.
 The problem of fragmented empirical heuristic has been particularly acute
 in studies of Chinese politics.
 This in part has a lot to do with highly secretive nature of Chinese politics.
 Applying survey and interview methods may not only be extremely costly
 but also potentially dangerous to researchers.
 Much of the scholarly inquiry has been based on anecdotal and impressionistic
 “readings of the tea leaves” 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Only recently, scholars have introduced two main quantitative approaches,

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first approach focuses on question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who's in charge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and aims to assess the actual political power and influence of individual
 elites.
 As highlighted by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Ban2018"

\end_inset

, despite of the critical importance of power in political science, empirical
 work on this fundamental subject is hampered by the fact that actually
 observing power is difficult.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Jaros2017"

\end_inset

 propose that one way to evaluate CCP elites' position within the party-state
 is to collect and analyze news coverage of official media.
 They argue that the official media in authoritarian settings like China
 plays an important role to signal political power to citizens and elites
 as much as to indoctrinate them or shape their underlying belief structures
 and values.
 Elites’ ability to dominate official media coverage implies that they have
 power over key organizations and information flows and thus signals a strong
 political grip.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Jaros2017"

\end_inset

, therefore, analyze CCP elites that dominate media coverage in China’s
 provincial-level newspapers.
 Using named-entity recognition (NER) methods, they are able to identify
 and tabulate virtually all the mentions of different organizations and
 individuals appearing in a collection of provincial official newspapers.
 Their analyses show that Xi Jinping received proportionately greater media
 coverage than Hu Jintao, which is consistent with perceptions about his
 personalization of power.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second approach, on the other hand, examines dyadic homophily and affinity
 between a pair of elites, that is, the question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who's who.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This empirical approach is inspired by the thesis of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

factional politics,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which postulates that patron-client relationships developed over the course
 of a patron’s career served as platforms whereby regime goods such as promotion
s and money for the clients were exchanged for political support for the
 patron 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Pye1981,Nathan1995,Dittmer1995b,Shih2010,Shih2012"

\end_inset

.
 Empirically, scholars have relied on biographical archives and examined
 shared attributes of CCP elites.
 Based an extensive review, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Meyer2016"

\end_inset

 identify four different measurements of factional ties.
 While 
\emph on
Broad Ties
\emph default
 are the most expansive one used in existing literature, which records all
 native place, school, and work ties accumulated by a party secretary prior
 to his ascension to the top position.
 The second measurement, i.e., 
\emph on
Complete Work Ties
\emph default
, records the work ties that patrons accumulated prior to appointment to
 the party secretary general post, and the third measurement (Early Work
 Ties) records only work ties that a patron accumulates prior to his entrance
 into the Politburo.
 Finally, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Keller2016"

\end_inset

 proposes a highly restrictive definition of faction, which records the
 relationship between a patron and a client only if the client enjoyed a
 promotion within the same work unit while she worked with the patron.
 After comparing these four measurements, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Meyer2016"

\end_inset

 find that Hu Yaobang, Jiang Zemin, and Xi Jinping pursued broadly based
 factional recruitment strategies, while Hu Jintao recruited faction members
 mainly from work colleagues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While these two approaches provide us important insights about elite dynamics
 of the CCP regime, we find two outstanding problems.
 First, we still lack a systematic empirical heuristic to bridge and incorporate
 the existing two approaches.
 Second and more importantly, the existing approaches fall short in revealing
 more indirect and latent relationship between CCP elites beyond direct
 work ties.

In this study, we conceptualize elites' public appearances as political
 
\emph on
foci
\emph default
.
 The concept is originally introduced by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Feld1981"

\end_inset

 to analyze how people are interlinked via various social activities.
 The relevant aspects of the social environment can be seen as foci around
 which individuals organize their social relations.
 A focus is defined as a social, psychological, legal, or physical entity
 around which joint activities are organized (e.g., workplaces, voluntary
 organizations, hangouts, families, etc).
 Similarly, the public events that elites attend can be regarded as political
 foci around which CCP elites interact with each other.
 Political foci therefore are a duality of elites and events, and together
 they constitute an affiliation network that reveals important information
 of CCP elites' coordination and control.
 Much of the scholarly inquiry has been based on anecdotal and impressionistic
 “readings of the tea leaves” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This duality perspective is fundamentally relational.
 Rather than examining specific events or individual elites, we focus on
 how elites are connected via a variety of political events.
 Political elites intersect with each other within different political events,
 which are created based on shared policy problems or personal affinities.
 Multiple attendances of elites provide conduits for the flow of information
 between political foci and for the coordination of policies across different
 foci.
 At the same time, the particular patterning of an elite's public appearance
 defines her or his points of reference in the CCP's nebulous party-state.
 Political events as collections of actors not only provide the opportunity
 for contacts between elites, for sharing of information or other resources
 among elites, but also facilitate formation of pairwise ties between elites.
 In other words, public events create linkages between elites, elites create
 linkages between public events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key insight from this foci perspective, therefore, is that elites' appearanc
es in different political events can constitute a complex interlocking network.
 More importantly, the interlocking network structure helps reveal system-level
 attributes of the CCP regime, which cannot be reduced to individual or
 event-level.
 As elites connect to each other via multiple events, these links are not
 only able to channel important resources like information, but also can
 support mechanisms through which elites monitor and sanction each other.
 The interlocking network of public appearance, therefore, could strongly
 shape the overall patterns of collaboration and control among CCP elites.
 In other words, a duality conceptualization of elites' public appearance
 points to the necessity to explore the complex interlocking network in
 which elites embedded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To analyze elite coappearances as a form of relational data assumes that
 the coappearances are not atomistic, independent events, but are part of
 an interdependent network.
 In general, networks have three main types of interdependencies – first,
 second, and third order – and in this study we focus on the first and third
 order relationships.

Second order relationships, reciprocity, is not relevant when dealing with

\end_inset

 First order dependencies, as discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Kenny2006"

\end_inset

, discuss the greater tendency of certain actors to undertake certain behaviors.
 In the case of China, for example, Xi Jinping is simply going to make more
 coappearances in aggregate than would a junior member of the party.
 Thus, if we compare two possible coappearances, and they both involve Xi,
 an appearance would be more likely then in the average case.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Relational data is also subject to third order dependencies factors that
 induce transitivity and clusters in networked data.
 In particular we focus on two types of third order dependencies – homophily
 and stochastic equivalence.
 Homophily is the tendency for actors who share unobserved characteristics,
 for example their preferences on corruption policy, are more likely to
 be linked and make coappearances than actors that do not share those characteri
stics.
 Stochastic equivalence is the idea that actors might have similar roles
 in the network, and thus be more or less likely to make appearances with
 common third parties.
 If two elites in China are both proteges of Xi Jinping, then they are both
 more likely to make co-appearances with Xi and his other proteges, and
 less likely to make co-appearances with Xi's rivals and his rival's proteges.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can thus think of an elite coappearance as being the product of three
 factors.
 The first factor is who matters, which actors are generally more popular
 and active than others.
 The second factor is an actors position in the system of relationships
 in Chinese elite politics, the actors' homophily and stochastic equivalence
 with the elite they are potentially appearing with.
 Finally, coappearances also have random, unmodeled noise that makes certain
 appearances more or less likely.
 We need a model that can disaggregate these factors in order to uncover
 elite factions and groupings in Chinese politics.

Data: Elite Coappearances
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In recently years, scholars have increasingly rely on relational data to
 explore the complex interactions among political elites.
 Most quantitative research of network analysis in political science relies
 on carefully designed survey to collect relational data.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

, for instance, conducted extensive survey of delegates of EU member states
 and explore how their cooperation patterns evolve over time in the EU Council.
 While techniques for network data collection have yielded fruitful relational
 data sets thus far, besides the apparent access problem, two limitations
 stand out in using survey approach to assemble relational data in non-democraci
es.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first is respondent-induced measurement error.
 Though measurement error occurs in all social network research, designs
 that rely on self-reports are particularly vulnerable 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Wasserman1994"

\end_inset

.
 The validity of self-reported social ties is threatened by respondent bias
 in whom subjects choose to report as their friends, especially when dealing
 with political elites.
 Archival-based methods solve these problems by capturing behavioral rather
 than reported ties.
 Yet, these techniques require an identifiable and consistent corpus of
 text to analyze that limits these techniques to studies of presidents,
 legislators, party affiliates, and judges.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we rely on a unique dataset from the China Vitae project,
 which tracks the appearances and travel of over 200 leading CCP elites.
 Information is available on the date and location of the activity, officials
 in attendance, the topics raised, and the source of the data.
 Specifically, we focus on their public appearance between January 1st,
 2013 and January 1st, 2017.
 This allows us to systematically examine elites' interaction in Xi's first
 tenure.

Figure 1 plots the total number of public appearances, and those associated
 with Xi Jinping (i.e., red) and Li Keqiang (i.e., blue) respectively.
 A quick examination of total appearances points to consistent annual patterns
 across the four years.
 While there are much fewer public appearance in the Chinese traditional
 spring holidays and August, elites' activities peak in March and September.
 This confirms the observations made by close watchers of China's elite
 politics.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 suggests that the low points in August can be explained by the CCP's tradition
 of Beidaihe retreat.
 A comparison of Xi and Li's public appearances also reveal some interesting
 patterns.
 While their total appearances crisscross with each other a lot between
 2013 and 2014, Xi made markedly more public appearance starting from 2015.

 total appearance, and the dashed blue line denotes the share of their coappeara

 A contrast of these two lines then reveals interesting changes over time.
 First, the two lines crisscross each other throughout the four year time

 Yet, we can find that for both Xi and Li, their shares of coappearances
 have declined steadily over time.

 Unlike Xi-Li coappearance, we can find Xi-Zhang coappearances are highly

We rely on the latent factor model (LFM) to uncover the latent elite patterns
 that determine coappearances for Chinese elites.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is particularly useful to us is that this latent factor model accounts
 for these interdependencies by positioning actors in a 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 dimensional latent vector space, in this space, actors which have their
 vectors pointed in similar dimensions are more likely to have similar preferenc
es and be members of the same factions, and the angle between these actors
 vectors provide a measure of how similar the preferences and factional
 links are.
 This allows us not only to estimate the likelihood of coappearances, but
 also to map actors positions in the space, which we can then use to predict
 elite behavior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We generate this measure by constructing 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 different 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$

M & =A+U\Lambda U^{\top}

\end_inset

(in this case a count) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{\top}\mathbf{X}$
\end_inset

 is the standard regression term for dyadic and nodal fixed effects.
 In this application, for the sake of parsimony we abstain from using fixed
 effects.
 However, if one was interested in estimating a measure of factions that
 accounted for, for example, seasonal variation in coappearances or institutiona
lly mandated coappearances, we could have a model that parsed out these
 effects magnitude of coappearances.

\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is systematic effects representing first and third order dependencies.
 $A$ represents nodal random effects, which are included to account for
 first-order dependencies – who matters and their overall level of activity.
 By matrix theory, we can factorize the multiplicative effects into the
 product of two simpler matrices: 
\begin_inset Formula $U\Lambda U^{\top}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}\in{\rm I\!R^{k}}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$

 is a

 Thus under this framework a vector of latent characteristics are estimated
 for each actor, 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}=\{u_{i,1},\ldots,u_{i,k}\}$
\end_inset

 Similarity in the latent factors between two actors,

 matrix which represents each actors vector in the

-dimensional latent network.
 But key to interpreting this space is that it is non-Euclidean, as actor's
 latent positions are actually embedded within a 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-dimensional hyper sphere, and so we cannot simply look at distances in
 this space.
 Rather, the important measure here is an actors vector in this space, and
 the similarity between the vector of one actor and another.
 Comparing the similarity of preferences between two states, 
\begin_inset Formula $\{i,j\}$
\end_inset

, can be accomplished by comparing the direction to which their respective
 factor vectors point.
 A commonly used metric for this sort of problem in the recommender system
 literature from computer science is the cosine of the angle formed by the
 latent vectors of both actors.

 We refer to this distance metric as latent angle distance.
 Thus, if the estimated latent vectors of two actors are in the same direction,
 they are apt to have made appearances with similar partners.
 We measure this by looking at the absolute distance of the angles created
 by each officials position and the center of the latent network in a given
 year.

Testing Case: Leading Small Groups
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test the validity of our measures, we attempt to estimate membership
 on the Leading Small Groups (LSG) using measures of latent similarity we
 discuss above.
 To contribute to the debate, we focus on a critical and unique arrangement
 in the Chinese party-state, the leading small groups (LSGs).
 LSGs, though not incorporated into charts of Party or government organs,
 play a pivotal role in communicating, coordinating, and implementing of
 important decisions across different segments and various levels of the
 governments.
 LSGs, therefore, not only can serve as an institutional remedy to the regime's
 prolonged problem of political fragmentation, but also, as shown by the
 development of the infamous Central Cultural Revolution Group (1966-69),
 LSGs could become an effective vehicle for expansion of personal power.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study we examine LSGs at the national level as well as their members,
 and we further differentiate between Central Committee (

 All LSGs are involved in the collecting and providing policy intelligence,

 However, only a small share of them has coordination (

 The ones that do have, often include stakeholders that are strictly speaking
 outside of the party-state bureaucracy, such as business associations.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

before "e.g.,"

.
 Yet, a bipartite graph complicates its calculation and interpretation since
 two types of degree distributions are available, one for elites (i.e., 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

how many LSGs an elite is appointed to
\begin_inset Quotes erd

) and one for LSGs (i.e., 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

how many members a LSG is consisted of
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 Here we are interested in the extent which elites are assigned to multiple
 LSGs, and Fig.
 5 plots degree distributions respectively.
 An examination of Fig.
 5a shows the Party LSG network differs significantly from a random network
 in three ways.
 First, there are much more nodes with low degrees in the Party LSG network.
 Specifically, the Party LSG network deviates from a random one in its systemati
c control over membership concurrency.
 Most elites are assigned to a single LSG, and only a few are appointed
 to multiple LSGs.
 Second, while a random network lacks hub nodes with high degrees, the Party
 LSG network has a few central nodes.
 Finally, differing from random network, the Party LSG network has a much
 smaller number of nodes with middle range degrees.
 In contrast, the State LSG network deviates from random networks only in
 its larger number of low-degree nodes.
 Together, these findings suggest that compared to that of the State LSG
 network, the degree distribution of Party LSG network is more like a fat-tail
 one, which is usually the hallmark characteristic of the centralized scale
 free network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that Chinese elites can be members of multiple LSGs, and that we have
 reason to believe that more powerful members of the party are in more of
 these groups, we start by using a count model of membership, in particular
 a negative-binomial regression.
 We compare three main models.
 Our null model looks simply at the individuals total level of appearances
 in the Chinese Vitae data, this provides an approximate measure of popularity
 at the individual level.
 We also look at a measure that includes both total appearances and coappearance
s with Xi Jinping, attempting to capture the direct dyadic relationship
 with the Chairman of the party.
 Finally, our main model includes overall appearances, and rather than looking
 at appearances with Xi, we look at the latent angle similarity an elite
 has with Xi, which gets at not only their direct interactions, but also
 third order effects like homophily and stochastic equivalence.

The results of the three models are reported in Figure 6.
 Interestingly, while coappearances with Xi do not have a robust relationship
 to placement on more LSGs, the latent distance measure is significant and
 in the predicted direction — elites who are further from Xi in the latent
 space are seated on more Leading Small Groups.
 In Figure 7 we show the expected number of LSGs an elite with an average
 number of total appearances would be appointed to based on their latent
 distance from Xi, for that elite, moving from the closest angle distance
 observed to the furthest is associated with a drop in LSG appointment of
 about 2.5.
 We also see that when we take into account latent proximity to Xi Jinping,
 the first order characteristics cease to matter, whereas they have the
 predicted positive effects (elites that make more appearances also sit
 on more LSGs) in the other models.

While it is heartening that our measure of Chinese latent proximity conforms
 to our theoretical expectations in terms of conventional statistical significan
ce, the more relevant test is whether it improves our ability to predict
 behavior out of sample.
 To do this, we divide Chinese elites into 20 groups at random, and in each
 case predict how many LSGs an elite in that group will be appointed to
 using a model fit on the other 19 groups.
 We do this for each of our three main models.
 As you can see in table 1, the model using latent angle similarity significantl
y outperforms the models that only use total and coappearances, showing
 that this measure of latent similarity helps us to predict promotion to
 the Leading Small Group.

Of course, not all LSGs are the same.
 There are groups at the State level and at the Central level.
 Based on institutional setup, while Xi has the final say on appointments
 to the Federal LSGs, Premiere Li Keqiang is responsible for the state level
 ones.
 Thus, to account for these differences, we run a bivariate probit analysis,
 which simultaneously estimates the likelihood that an elite will be appointed
 to any Central or State LSGs.
 Again in this analysis, latent distance from Xi has a consistent negative
 effect for both types of LSGs.

Finally, we attempt to look at models based on distance, not to Xi Jinping,
 but to Li Keqiang, to see how well individuals closer to Xi's rival perform
 in terms of appointment to these groups.
 We find that latent distance from Li, as depicted in Figure 8, is similarly
 associated with a lower probability of appointment to LSGs.
 However, combining the two distance measures results in a model that has
 ambiguous effects, and this is in part because for most members of the
 party, distance from Xi and Li are highly collinear.
 Importantly however, they differ for some individuals.
 However, as depicted in Table 3, inclusion of latent distance to Li Keqiang
 actually results in a 
\emph on
worse
\emph default
 performing model out of sample.
 This implies that, for elites where their distance to Xi and Li diverge
 (because they are between them in the latent angle space) adding information
 about proximity to Li actually hurts the model's performance.
 This might be because Xi has such a dominant hand in determining advancement
 in the party.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion and discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we propose a latent network approach to explore the dynamic
 interactions of the CCP elites.
 We conceptualize public co-appearances as “foci,” around which various
 political activities are organized.
 Since elites’ engagement in these foci is highly selective, their co-appearance
s signal important information about elites’ collusion and cooptation.
 Based a unique dataset, we aim to answer three critical questions — 1)
 who's in charge, (2) who's who, and (3) who are my allies — by examining
 elites’ total appearances, dyadic coappearances, and finally their latent
 network distance.
 We further find that while elites’ total appearance and their latent network
 distances are strongly associated with their LSG memberships, dyadic coappearan
ce is much weaker in predicting LSG memberships.
