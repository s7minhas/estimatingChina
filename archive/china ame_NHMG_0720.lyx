\begin_layout Abstract
\align left
How ruling elite arrange and maintain their power-sharing is key to our understanding of authoritarian politics. We propose a latent space framework to systematically analyze the dynamics of elite power-sharing in authoritarian regimes. We also introduce a novel dataset tracking appearances of elite Chinese Community Party (CCP) members at political events. Our new framework and data allow us to disentangle three key aspects of CCP elite power-sharing: (1) whose in charge, (2) who do I work with, and (3) who are my friends. Using a latent factor network analysis of approximately 10,000 appearance records of over 200 top CCP elites from 2013 to 2017, we empirically assess these three questions by computing elites' total appearances, dyadic coappearances, and their distance in a latent social space. We test how well these three indicators fare at predicting elites’ appointments to the most important policymaking body in contemporary China, the leading small groups (LSGs) of the CCP Central Committee and the Central Government.

 We also introduce a new type of data that has yet to come to attention of scholars of authoritarian politics, that is, elite appearance and coappearance at political events. Our new framework and data allow us to disentangle and synthesize three key aspects of elite power-sharing in authoritarian regimes: (1) who are in charge, (2) who do I work with, and (3) who are my friends. The question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 focuses on the power and influence of 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 points to the

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 approach will, we argue, overlook indirect relationships between elites and ignore information about latent coalitions. For instance, without a direct collegial or patronage connection, two elites may still belong to an unobserved coalition because of ties to a common friend. The question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 then captures such indirect

LSGs not only ameliorate the regime's prolonged problem of political fragmentation, they can also be an effective vehicle for overpassing formal institutions and asserting personal influences as shown by the infamous Central Cultural Revolution Group (1966-69). Recently, it has been found that Xi relied heavily on LSGs to push forward institutional reforms and policy changes

. Our tests then show that while elites' total appearances are strongly associated with their appointments in LSGs memberships, their dyadic coappearances bear a much weaker association. Most notably, the best predictor of LSG membership is our latent measure of network proximity.

Our study contributes to the extant studies of authoritarian politics in many ways. First, our latent space framework provides a possible approach to bridge and synthesize the fragmented studies of the ruling elite in authoritarian regimes. This allows us to develop a systematic assessment of their power-sharing patterns and dynamics. Second, our approach explicitly highlights and models the latent relationships between elites, which so far has received only scant scholarly attention. As revealed in our analysis of LSG appointments, the incorporation of such latent distances could significantly improve our assessment about elite power-sharing. Finally, our study introduces a novel source of data, i.e., public appearances of the elite. The appearance data not only complements our existing data like news coverage and biographical archives, but, more importantly, allows for a systematic exploration of the dynamic and relational changes in elite power-sharing.

Such studies are particularly developed in the studies of the CCP elite, and they largely fall into two separate lines of inquiries: (1) identifying key actors (i.e., the positional approach) and (2) exploring their relations (i.e., the relational approach).

The relational approach, on the other hand, examines 
\emph on

 affinity and ties between elites. This empirical approach rests on the thesis of factional politics. It postulates that the political struggle between competing factions is the key to our understanding of CCP elite politics, and that a faction typically develops from patron-client relationships that are cultivated by a patron through the career path

\end_inset

 identify four different empirical indicators of factional ties: broad ties, complete work ties, early work ties, and restrictive work ties. They further examine how CCP elites' varying ties with the party secretary general predict their promotion into the Central Committee. Their analysis shows that while work ties with the secretary general consistently matter, non-work ties (e.g., a common educational background) sometimes could also help. In light of this, by steering our attention to factional ties associated with key patrons, this approach helps us to move beyond the power core and probe links among ruling elites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
While these two approaches provide us with important insights about elite dynamics of the CCP regime, we find that some critical problems remain unresolved. First and foremost, we still lack a conceptual framework to synthesize different insights from existing studies (e.g., dynamic changes of personal powers on the one hand and abiding factional ties between patrons and clients on the other). This in turn hinders our systematic understanding of elite power-sharing. Second and more specifically, our emphasis on key patrons and their direct clients tends to leave valuable information neglected. This is mainly due to the importance and prevalence of 
\emph on
indirect
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
non-dyadic
\emph default
 relationships. A client of a factional leader, for instance, could also serve as the patron for other elites.

The existence of such indirect relationships not only significantly increases the scope of factions, but, more importantly, generates a complex interdependent network of elites. Without a systemic study of such indirect relationships, we are unable to answer a series of important questions like hierarchies within factions or nuanced distinctions between apathetic and antagonistic relationships. We are limited to only looking at direct relationships rather than being able to holistically study the complete system of affinity, patronage, and antipathy. Thus we argue that understanding elite dynamics, and thus authoritarian politics writ large, requires both new conceptual exploration and empirical strategies.

Elite Power-Sharing as a Latent Space

In this study, we conceptualize the elite power-sharing in authoritarian regimes as a latent space. This latent space not only encompasses a collection of individual elites, it subsumes all the relationships between them, direct or indirect. In light of this, a latent space understanding allows us to synthesize both 
\emph on

 and 
\emph on

 (p. 89). Recognizing this, Dahl proposes to focus on political events and meetings where the actual processes of influence are at work. For instance, after observing local political nominations, Dahl finds that

In this study, we follow Dahl's approach and turn to what we call power

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 to explore people's complex and embedded social circles in a community. A focus is usually defined as a social entity or event around which joint activities are organized (e.g., voluntary organizations, hangouts, and families). Since it is around these foci that individuals organize their social relations, we can learn essential features of their latent social space by studying the observable foci. Similarly, we argue that political events like ceremonies, policy meetings, and state visits can be treated as power foci, around which the ruling elite signal and manage their power relationships. For instance, an elite's presence in a policy meeting would suggest her or his involvement in the decision-making activities and thus convey valuable information about the actual processes of influence. As the ruling elite coordinate with each other via numerous such events, we can approximate their latent space of power-sharing by examining how these foci are interconnected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The interlocking network of power foci reveals both positional and relational attributes about the ruling elite. It is positional in its ability to uncover individual elites' relative activeness and prominence in events where the actual processes of influence are at work. Moreover, the particular patterning of an elite's appearance defines her or his points of reference in the nebulous ruling group. This is consistent with Dahl's

\end_inset

 emphasis on observing decision-making activities. The interlocking foci network is also relational. Beyond specific events or individual elites, it shows how elites are connected via a variety of political events. Political elites intersect with each other within different political events, which are created based on shared policy problems or personal affinities. These links are not only able to channel important resources like information, but also can support mechanisms through which elites monitor and sanction each other.

 Questions in a Latent Space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

So how can we approximate the latent space of power-sharing from the interlocking foci network? In this study, we treat the foci network as a product of both stochastic and strategic factors. We further disaggregate the strategic factors into three questions — i.e., who are in charge, who do I work with, and who are my friends, which correspond to the individual level characteristics, dyadic links, and latent affinities. Generally speaking, our approach can be summarized as follows: after controlling for random noise, powerful elites (i.e., who are in charge) are more likely to make appearances; elites who are in the same and related policy domains (i.e., who do I work with) are more likely to appear together; and finally elites who share latent affinities (i.e., who are my friends) are more likely to show up together. Together, the

 who questions help us to approximate the latent space of elite power-sharing.

The first two who questions are quite consistent with the existing studies of elite politics. Similar to such positional studies as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, the question of who are in charge is focused on network dynamics that are stemmed from characteristics of individual elites. For instance, certain type of actors tend to be more active in initiating connections. In our case of elite politics, this suggests that powerful elites are more likely to preside and participate in important ceremonies and meetings. From the network analysis perspective, this greater tendency of certain actors to undertake certain behaviors is usually referred as first-order dependencies

. For example, we expect that Xi Jinping is simply going to make more appearances in aggregate than would a junior CCP elite. That is, if we compare two possible elites, a third person is 
\emph on
ceteris paribus
\emph default
 more likely to make a coappearance with Xi than with the junior CCP elite. On the other hand, the second who question examines if two elites attend the same event. Given its focus on the observable direct and dyadic links, this question follows an approach similar to that of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

. The question of

 then highlights whether there is a direct coordination and collaboration between a pair of elites.
\end_layout

 Simply using direct and dyadic links as a proxy of the latent affinity could lead to two types of errors, the incorrect rejection of a true friend and the false acceptance of a real enemy. A simply example of the first error is an indirect patronage relationship which involves a patron, a client, and a sub-client. If we rely solely on dyadic coappearance, we may end up in wrongly rejecting the relationship between the patron and sub-client. The second error could also occur in a three-party relationship when an elite share links with two rival patrons. In this case, we could run into either a false conclusion or no conclusion at all. Provided with these possible errors, some scholars have questioned the validity of factional studies based on dyadic analyses. For example,

, a long-time observer of CCP elite politics, points to two problematic cases, Liu Yunshan and Li Yuanzhao, both of whom share strong ties with the competing Jiang and Hu factions. Without a consistent criterion, she argues

 (p. 7).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
In this study, we argue that the above problems stem from the prevalence of indirect ties in elite politics, and one remedy is to examine the more complex and indirect relationships elites form. We thus turn to the question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 which is commonly referred to as a third order dependency in network analysis.

\begin_layout Standard
Second-order dependencies refers to reciprocity, which does not apply to our case here.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Unlike first-order dependencies that are associated with attributes of individual actors, such high-dimensional dependencies usually arise from mechanisms such as homophily and stochastic equivalence. Homophily is the tendency for actors who share similar characteristics, such as patron-client linkages, to be more likely to form ties with one another than actors that do not share those characteristics. Stochastic equivalence is the idea that actors might have similar roles in the network, and thus be more or less likely to make appearances with common coalitions. If two elites in China are both protégés of Xi Jinping, then they are both more likely to make co-appearances with Xi and his other protégés, and less likely to make co-appearances with Xi's rivals and his rivals' protégés. Therefore, a systematic study of such indirect ties helps us to understand the complex interdependencies between elites and thus provides a more accurate answer to the question of

In this study, we rely on a unique database from the China Vitae project, which traces the public appearances of CCP elites. We focus on the time period between January 1 2013 and January 1 2017, which provides us with approximately 10,000 appearance records for over 200 elites. This allows us to systematically examine the elite power-sharing in Xi's first term. Table 1 presents a small sample of our dataset and reports the date, the event, and elites in attendance.

 From Table 1, we show that our dataset captures how top CCP elites structured their power relationships via a variety of political activities, ranging from the civil-military unity meeting to the China-US summit. As argued above, these power foci constitute an interlocking network of events and elites, and Figure 1a shows how the six events in Table 1 could form a simple interlocking network. Since our main focus is elite relationship, we then extract the elite coappearance network as shown in Figure 1b, and such coappearance networks serve as the starting point of our later analyses (also see Figure 4).

 by calculating elites' total appearances and coappearances. Figure 2 plots the total number of elite appearances (gray), as well as those associated with Xi Jinping (red) and Li Keqiang (blue) respectively. A quick examination shows a consistent annual pattern. There are notably fewer elite appearances in February and August, and their activities peak in March and September. While the low points in springs are mainly due to the Chinese new year, the high points in August accord with elites the CCP's tradition of meeting at Beidaihe

. A comparison of Xi and Li's appearances points to some interesting changes. In 2013 and 2014, we can find that their total appearances frequently intersected. Yet starting from 2015 Xi has made markedly more appearances. This corroborates with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In Figure 3a, the red line denotes the number of times Xi-Li coappeared at an event as a share of Xi's total appearances. The dashed blue line also denotes the number of Xi-Li coapperances, but as a share of Li's total appearances. From Figure 3a, we find that the two lines intersected throughout the four years, and their shares of coappearances have declined over time. In other words, for both Xi and Li, their coappearances account for similar weights in their total activities, though they are gradually departing away from each other. However, Xi-Zhang coappearances in Figure 2b show a different trend. Xi-Zhang coappearances are highly asymmetrical. The share of their coappearance is markedly more salient for Zhang, indicating the extent to which Zhang is overshadowed by Xi.

Finally, we plot the complete coappearance network in Figure 4. It shows that the set of interactions captured in the coappearance network form a complex system. While there are a few actors towards the right that only appear with one or two other actors, most fall into the broader interconnected system at the left of Figure 4. Moreover, within the broader interconnected component, we can find notable higher order structures like triangular relationships that cannot be addressed by examining dyadic ties. One way to quantify such higher order structures is a transitivity statistic.

 A significant amount of higher order structures leads to a high clustering coefficient. In our case of the CCP elite coappearance network, we find that the statistic is 0.67 on a scale from 0 to 1, indicating a large degree of higher order dependencies. In the following section, we discuss our approach to systematically estimate latent affinities between actors in a network with higher order dependencies.

\end_inset

. The LFM positions actors in a 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 dimensional latent vector space based on third order dependence patterns. In this space, actors whose vectors point in similar dimensions are more likely to share similar preferences and be members of the same latent coalitions. The angles between these vectors then provides a measure of the extent to which the preferences and factional links are similar. Given its ability to capture latent affinities between interconnected actors, LFM has been used to infer state foreign policy preferences

More formally, we conduct the analysis as follows. We treat our coappearance network as an 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix, where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 denotes the number of elites, and the matrix cell 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{ij}$
\end_inset

 represents the number of coappearances between elite 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and elite 
\begin_inset Formula $j$

\begin_layout Standard
It should be noted that the coappearance data is symmetric and so 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{ij}=y_{ji}$
\end_inset

 for all

\end_inset

. The approach we describe below has already been generalized to the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{ij}\neq y_{ji}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 To obtain the latent affinities between elites (i.e., a lower-dimension relational measure), we then have an LFM as follows, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
Y & =f(\theta)\\
\theta & =\beta^{\top}\mathbf{X}+Z\\
Z & =M+E\\
M & =U\Lambda U^{\top}
\end{align}
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}\in{\rm I\!R^{k}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $k\times k$
\end_inset

 diagonal matrix. 
\begin_inset Formula $f(.)$
\end_inset

 is a general link function corresponding to the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 (in our case the coappearance count), and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{\top}\mathbf{X}$

 is the standard regression term for dyadic and nodal fixed effects.

For our interest in latent affinity, the key output is

 is an 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times k$

 matrix that represents each actors vector in the

-dimensional latent network. It captures the effect of stochastic equivalence and homophily on official appearances. But a caveat in interpreting this space is that it is non-Euclidean, as the actor vectors are embedded within a 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-dimensional hyper sphere. We thus cannot simply use distances in this space as a measure of latent affinities. Rather, the important measure here is an actor's vector in this space, and the similarity between the vector of one actor and another. Comparing the similarity between two elites, 
\begin_inset Formula $\{i,j\}$
\end_inset

, can be accomplished by comparing the direction to which their respective factor vectors point. A commonly used metric for this sort of problem is the cosine of the angle formed by the latent vectors of both actors.

\begin_layout Standard
The method is well developed in the recommender system literature of computer science. It is calculated in the following way, where 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 represents the 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times k$
\end_inset

 matrix of actor vectors, 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Latent angle distance}_{ij}=\frac{u_{i}\cdot u_{j}}{||u_{i}||\cdot||u_{j}||}*(-1)$
\end_inset

. 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We refer to this distance metric as latent angle distance. More concretely, if the estimated latent vectors of two actors are in the same direction, they are apt to have made appearances with similar partners. We measure this by looking at the absolute distance of the angles created by each officials position and the center of the latent network, and the results are plotted in Figure 5.

\begin_layout Standard
In Figure 5, we can find CCP elites in our dataset fall into two clusters that are centered around Xi (i.e., the lower cluster) and Li (i.e., the upper cluster). To gain a better view about key elites, we present the slices of Politburo members of the 18th and 19th Central Committee in Figure 6. First, consistent with Figure 5, the 18th Politburo members as shown in Figure 6a are also divided into the two clusters. More interesting, while the other three Vice Premiers (i.e., Liu Yandong, Wang Yang, and Ma Kai) are sided with Li, the first Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli is much closer to Xi. Second, in contrast to Figure 5 where more elites are found in the upper cluster, the majority of Politburo members in Figure 6a are clustering around Xi. Particularly, the two military members, Xu Qiliang and Fan Changlong, are also in the lower cluster. This dominant Xi cluster is consistent with findings of

\end_inset

. Third, Figure 6a also points an outlier elite in the upper left corner, Sun Zhengcai, who is a remote member of the Li cluster. However, Sun is almost diagonal to Xi, that is, a position farthest possible from Xi in the latent space. Our data point stop on January 1st 2017, and seven months later Sun was abruptly removed from his office as the party secretary of Chongqing. Finally, Figure 6b plots members of 19th Politburo who were elected over ten months after our last data point. It shows that how this approach is able to pick up potential changes in the Politburo. Together, the above findings suggest our approach suffice to meet satisfactory face validity.

The results of our first three models are reported in Table 2. First, our baseline model (square) suggests that elites' total appearances matter in LSG appointments. Those 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who are in change
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 do attend more LSGs. Second, as shown in the coappearance model (circle), simply joining Xi in same political events (i.e., those 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who work with Xi
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) does make CCP elites with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who work with Xi
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in fact, this relationship is weakly significant in the 
\backslash
emph{opposite} direction. This confirms our earlier discussion that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who do I work with
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 could run into two types of errors and mask the latent affinities between elites. Finally, in contrast to coappearances, the latent distance measure is significant and in the predicted direction. Elites who are closer to Xi in the latent space (i.e., those 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who are Xi's friends
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) are seated on more LSGs.

In Figure 8, we show the expected number of LSGs an elite with an average number of total appearances would be appointed to based on their latent distance from Xi, for that elite, moving from the closest angle distance observed to the furthest is associated with a drop in LSG appointment of about 1.5.

While our measure of Chinese latent proximity conforms to our theoretical expectations in terms of conventional statistical significance, an important test is whether it improves our ability to predict behaviors out of sample. To do this, we divide Chinese elites into 20 groups at random, and in each case predict how many LSGs an elite in that group will be appointed to using a model fit on the other 19 groups. We do this for each of our three main models and report performance metrics in Table 3. We find the model using latent angle difference significantly outperforms the models that only use total and coappearances, showing that this measure of latent distance helps us to predict promotion to the Leading Small Group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Provided with the two clusters as shown in Figure 5, we further model LSG appointments based on distance to Li Keqiang, and the results are presented in Table 4. We find that latent distance from Li is similarly associated with a lower probability of appointment to LSGs. However, combining the two distance measures results in a model that has ambiguous effects. One reason is that for most members of the party, distance from Xi and Li are highly collinear. Importantly however, they differ for some individuals. As depicted in Table 5, inclusion of latent distance to Li does not necessarily improve model performance out of sample. This implies that, for elites whose distances to Xi and Li diverge, adding information about proximity to Li actually hurts the model's performance.

, there are marked structural differences between CC LSGs and SC LSGs. While CC LSGs is highly centralized, reflecting Xi's power grip the party, SC LSGs are far more decentralized and driven more by specific needs of policy collaboration. To probe these differences, we run a bivariate probit analysis, which estimates the likelihood that an elite will be appointed to any CC or SC LSGs jointly. From Table 6, we can find latent distance from Xi has a consistent and negative effect on the likelihood of appointment to CC LSGs, but there is no clear effect on SC LSGs. Conversely, distance from Li is associated with a lowered likelihood of appointment to SC LSGs, but not the CC ones. The ability to distinguish between promotion to CC and SC LSGs renders more support for our approach to approximating the latent affinities between CCP elites.

Conclusion and discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lacking strong and binding institutional rules, elite politics in authoritarian regimes tend to be opaque and volatile. This in turn introduces great difficulties for us to understand elite power-sharing where it is most needed. Particularly, as part of the global rise of strongman politics, Chinese politics under Xi has become less institutionalized and more personalist. To better understand these developments, we propose a latent space framework. We treat elite power-sharing as a latent space, and we argue that we can approximate this space by studying elites' appearances in various political events (i.e., power foci). Specifically, we highlight three crucial questions in this approximation, i.e., who are in charge, who do I work with, and who are my friends. After applying the latent factor model to the appearance data of CCP elites, we are able to capture elites’ total appearances, dyadic coappearances, and, most importantly, their latent network distance. We further examine how this approach could improve our understanding of such pivotal informal institutions as LSGs. Our tests show that the latent network distance greatly improves our prediction of LSG appointments. It significantly outperforms measures that simply look at individual power (who are in charge) and dyadic relationships (who do I work with). As an additional demonstration of the measure's efficacy, we also find that it helps reveal CCP's more nuanced power-sharing arrangements. While the proximity to Xi helps to explain LSGs of the Central Committee, it is the latent distances from Li that better explain those of the State Council.

By introducing this framework, our study presents a possible avenue to synthesize different aspects of elite power-sharing in authoritarian regimes. It not only encompasses positional status of individual elites, but also incorporates how they are interrelated. This allows us to develop a systematic view about the inherent and uneasy tensions among authoritarian elites. As long noted by

Chinese politics operated in an atmosphere of tension in which everyone sensed the need always to be careful and calculating about what was done or said

 (p. 36). The three who questions proposed in this study then help highlight their key heuristics. Particularly, our emphasis on the question of

 suggests that we need to move beyond direct dyadic relationships and explore the more nuanced and subtle higher order dependencies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Studies of elite politics in authoritarian regimes have also been long plagued with data paucity. Our study points to an alternative data source, appearance data, that could complement existing data like media coverage and biographical archives. Such data not only is dynamic, it also sheds light on the actual realization of power relationship as emphasized by

. As a preliminary exploration, our study is inevitably limited, and more systematic are called for to improve collection and analysis of such data.
