\begin_layout Abstract
How the ruling elite arrange and maintain their power-sharing is key to
 our understanding of authoritarian politics.
 We propose a latent space framework to systematically analyze the dynamics
 of elite power-sharing in authoritarian regimes.
 We also introduce a novel dataset tracking appearances of elite Chinese
 Community Party (CCP) members at political events.
 Our new framework and data allow us to disentangle three key aspects of

\change_inserted -1949513326 1531925920
Using a latent factor network analysis of about 10000 appearance records
 of over 200 top CCP elites from 2013 to 2017, w

 dyadic coappearances, and their latent network distance.
 We test how well these three indicators fare in predicting elites’ appointments
 in the leading small groups (LSGs) of the CCP Central Committee and the
 Central Government.

 A burgeoning literature turns to authoritarian institutions (e.g., national

 However, as stressed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, a fundamental dilemma confronting this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

institutional turn
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is that these institutions are inherently endogenous to strategic interactions
 of the ruling elite (also see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp

\end_inset

).
 That is, de facto cooperation and contention of the authoritarian elite
 still hide behind the facade of formal institutions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another group of scholars have adopted an alternative and elite-oriented
 approach to uncovering the inner workings of authoritarian regimes.
 Relying on a wide range of data like anecdotes, interviews, media coverage,
 and biographical archives, these studies try to identify key elites and
 analyze their social backgrounds, career patterns, and patronage ties 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 However, partly due to data limitations, we find few attempts to synthesize
 different aspects of elite dynamics, leaving us with only a fragmented
 perspective on power-sharing in authoritarian regimes.
 Unfortunately, it is this lack of a systematic approach that fundamentally
 constrains our understanding of authoritarian politics.
\end_layout

In this article, we propose a latent space framework to systematically map
 and analyze the dynamics of elite power-sharing in authoritarian regimes.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To clarify, here we use the term of latent space in a generic sense, i.e.,
 some area where elites with similar preference are in proximity to each
 other.
 In our later analysis, we treat the space as a latent factor space and
 use the the Latent Factor Model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hoff2005,Minhas2016a"

\end_inset

, which is different from the Latent Space Model proposed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Hoff2002"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We also introduce a new type of data that has yet to come to attention
 of scholars of authoritarian politics, that is, elite appearance and coappearan
ce at political events.
 Our new framework and data allow us to disentangle and synthesize three
 key aspects of elite power-sharing in authoritarian regimes: (1) who
\change_deleted -1949513326 1531919959
's
\change_inserted -1949513326 1531919960
 are
\change_unchanged
 in charge, (2) who do I work with, and (3) who are my friends.
 The question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who
\change_deleted -1949513326 1531919969
's
\change_inserted -1949513326 1531919970
 are
\change_unchanged
 in charge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 focuses on the power and influence of 
\emph on
individual
\emph default
 elites.
 The answer to this question is of critical importance in authoritarian
 regimes where formal political institutions are vulnerable to elites' manipulat
ion.
 Moving beyond individual and monadic elites, the question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who do I work with
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 points to the 
\emph on
dyadic
\emph default
 relationship between a given pair of elites (e.g., collegial ties and patronage
 connections), which serves as the very basis of coalitions and factions.
 However, a simple dyadic 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who do I work with
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 approach will, we argue, overlook the indirect and latent relationships
 between elites and forgo important information about latent coalitions.
 For instance, without a direct collegial or patronage connection, two elites
 could still form a latent coalition because of their ties to a common friend.
 The question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who are my friends
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 then captures such indirect 
\emph on
latent
\emph default
 connections between elites.
 Together, by jointly considering the monadic, dyadic, and latent attributes,
 the three 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

who
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 questions reveal systematic dynamics of elite power-sharing in authoritarian
 regimes.

Our empirical analyses and tests are focused on the Chinese Communist Party
 (CCP) regime.
 While the CCP regime has been commonly accepted as one of the most institutiona
lized and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

machine-like
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 rules are epiphenomenal to elite politics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 After Xi Jinping became the general secretary of CCP in 2012, the interest
 in elite power-sharing has been rekindled and become even more heated.
 Xi's first term was marked with major elite reshuffles, swift institutional
 changes, and wide-ranging policy alterations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Miller2014b,Naughton2014,Lampton2015,Shirk2018"

\end_inset

.
 These dramatic changes not only urge us to reassess CCP's intra-elite relations
, but also make it an ideal laboratory to explore the three 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 questions.
 Specifically, we utilize a latent factor network model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Minhas2016a"

\end_inset

 and analyze a unique database that tracks about 10000 appearance records
 of over 200 top CCP elites from 2013 to 2017.
 We attempt to answer the three 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 questions by computing elites' total appearances (i.e., 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

who

), dyadic coappearances (i.e., 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

), and, finally, their latent network distance (i.e., 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who are my friends
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 Together, our latent factor analysis of the appearance data presents a
 possible avenue to disentangle and synthesize key aspects of elite power-sharin
g in authoritarian regimes.

sample predictions of elites' appointments in the leading small groups (LSGs)
 of the CCP Central Committee and the Central Government 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Batke2017,Huhe2018a"

\end_inset

.
 LSGs are an informal institutional arrangement of CCP that has not been
 incorporated into charts of party or government organs.
 However, they play a pivotal role in formulating, coordinating, and implementin
g of important decisions across different segments and levels of the CCP
 regime 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hamrin1992,Lieberthal1992a"

\end_inset

.
 LSGs not only ameliorate the regime's prolonged problem of political fragmentat
ion, they can also be an effective vehicle for overpassing formal institutions
 and asserting personal influences as shown by the infamous Central Cultural
 Revolution Group (1966-69).
 Recently, it has been found that Xi relied heavily on LSGs to push forward
 institutional reforms and policy changes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Miller2014a,Naughton2014,Johnson2017,Lee2017,Shirk2018"

\end_inset

.
 Our tests then show that while elites' total appearances are strongly associate
d with their appointments in LSGs memberships, their dyadic coappearances
 bear a much weaker association.
 Most notably, the best predictor of LSG membership is our latent measure
 of network proximity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study contributes to the extant studies of authoritarian politics in
 many ways.
 First, our latent space framework (i.e., the three 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 questions) provides a possible approach to bridge and synthesize the fragmented
 studies of the ruling elite in authoritarian regimes.
 This allows us to develop a systematic assessment of their power-sharing
 patterns and dynamics.
 Second, our approach explicitly highlights and models the latent relationships
 between elites, which so far has received only scant scholarly attention.
 As revealed in our analysis of LSG appointments, the incorporation of such
 latent distances could significantly improve our assessment about elite
 power-sharing.
 Finally, our study introduces a new source of data, i.e., public appearances
 of the elite.
 The appearance data not only complements our existing data like news coverage
 and biographical archives, but, more importantly, allows for a systematic
 exploration of the dynamic and relational changes in elite power-sharing.

\begin_layout Section
Literature Review: The Elite and Their Relationships
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How to understand the elite and their relationships behind the facade of
 formal institutions has been one enduring question in social science.
 For instance, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

power elite
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 thesis emerged in 1950s stimulated a heated debate on whether power in
 America was concentrated on a small cohesive group of quasi-hereditary
 and well-positioned elites 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hunter1953,Mills2000,Dahl1961"

\end_inset

.
 The debate in turn has significantly advanced our understanding about the
 nature of democracy 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "e.g.,"
key "Dahl1971"

\end_inset

.
 In studies of authoritarian politics, scholars have been increasingly confronte
d by the same problem, particularly after the recent development in studies
 of authoritarian institutions.
 Although recent theoretical works like 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Svolik2012"

\end_inset

 provide us valuable insights to link authoritarian institutions with elite
 contention and cooperation, we still lack a systematic framework to conceptuali
ze and analyze the actual power-sharing dynamics in authoritarian regimes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our lack of a systematic framework has much to do with the highly secretive
 nature of authoritarian politics.
 It restricts researchers to employing methods such as Hunter's 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
key "Hunter1953"

\end_inset

 sociometric interviews emerged in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

power elite
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 debate.
 Many studies of authoritarian elites therefore have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

been based on anecdotal and impressionistic `readings of the tea leaves'
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "p. 137"
key "Ishiyama2014"

\end_inset

.
 Given these limitations, a number of scholars have introduced novel empirical
 approaches to explore different aspects of elite politics.
 Such studies are particularly developed in the studies of the CCP elite,
 and they largely fall into two separate lines of inquiries: (1) identifying
 key actors (i.e., the positional approach) and (2) exploring their relations
 (i.e., the relational approach).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, the positional approach focuses on 
\emph on
individual
\emph default
 elites and aims to assess their de facto positions within the CCP regimes.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Jaros2017"

\end_inset

 exemplifies this approach as they explore Xi's actual power and influence
 by examining CCP's official newspaper coverage.
 It is argued that the ruling elite usually rely on official media to signal
 their political presence and influence to the lower-level officials and
 the general public 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Huang2015b"

\end_inset

.
 Their coverage in official newspapers, therefore, can be used to infer
 their ability to dominate the party-state.
 Based on their 
\change_deleted -1949513326 1531922467
collection and 
\change_unchanged
analysis of province-level party newspapers between 2011 and 2014, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Jaros2017"

\end_inset

 find that Xi has received disproportionately more coverage over time, indicatin
g a consolidating grip on power.
 Such large-scale quantitative analysis of texts allow us to reveal ups
 and downs of key elites in a dynamic way.

 However, due to its focus on individual elites, this approach falls short
 in uncovering the relations between CCP elites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relational approach, on the other hand, examines 
\emph on
dyadic
\emph default
 affinity and ties between elites.
 This empirical approach is rested on the thesis of factional politics.
 It postulates that the political struggle between competing factions is
 the key to our understanding of CCP elite politics, and a faction usually
 grows out of patron-client relationships that are cultivated by a patron
 through the career path 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Pye1981,Nathan1995,Huang2000,Shih2010,Shih2012"

\end_inset

.
 Empirically, scholars rely 
\change_inserted -1949513326 1531946897
mainly 
\change_unchanged
on biographical archives to uncover such patron-client relationships.
 Based an extensive review, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Meyer2016"

\end_inset

 identify four different empirical indicators of factional ties, i.e., broad
 ties, complete work ties, early work ties, and restrictive work ties.
 They further examine how CCP elites' varying ties with the party secretary
 general predict their promotion into the Central Committee.
 Their analysis shows that while work ties with the secretary general consistent
ly matter, non-work ties (e.g., a common educational background) sometimes
 could also help.
 In light of this, by steering our attention to factional ties associated
 with key patrons, this approach helps us to move beyond the power core
 and probe links 
\change_deleted -1949513326 1531922678
across
\change_inserted -1949513326 1531922679
among
\change_unchanged
 ruling elites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While these two approaches provide us important insights about elite dynamics
 of the CCP regime, we find that some critical problems remain unresolved.
 First and foremost, we still lack a conceptual framework to synthesize
 different insights from the existing studies (e.g., dynamic changes of personal
 powers on the one hand and abiding factional ties between patrons and clients
 on the other).
 This in turn hinders our systematic understanding of elite power-sharing.
 Second and more specifically, our emphasis on key patrons and their direct
 clients tend to leave much valuable information neglected.
 This is mainly due to the importance and prevalence of 
\emph on

 A client of a factional leader, for instance, could also serve as the patron
 for other elites, forming a three-party relationship.
 The existence of such indirect relationships not only significantly increases
 the scope of factions, but, more importantly, generates a complex interdependen
t network of elites.
 Without a systemic study of such indirect relationships, we are unable
 to answer a series of important questions like hierarchies within factions
 or nuanced distinctions between apathetic and antagonistic relationships.

Elite Power-Sharing as a Latent Space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we conceptualize the elite power-sharing in authoritarian
 regimes as a latent space.
 This latent space not only encompasses a collection of individual elites,
 it subsumes all the relationships between them, direct or indirect.
 In light of this, a latent space understanding could allow us to synthesize
 both 
\emph on
positional
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
relational
\emph default
 attributes of the ruling elite and thus develop a systematic view about
 power-sharing in authoritarian regime.
 Yet, despite its apparent conceptual advantages, a latent space understanding
 requires us to answer two critical questions: (1) how to capture it and
 (2) how to analyze it.

, Dahl argues that the problem has risen from the obscure distinction between
 the legal theories of power and the realities of power: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the American creed of democracy and equality prescribes many forms and procedure
s from which the actual practices of leaders diverge.
 Consequently, to gain legitimacy for their actions leaders frequently surround
 their covert behavior with democratic rituals
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (p.
 89).
 Recognizing this, Dahl proposes to focus on political events and meetings
 where the actual processes of influence are at work.
 For instance, after observing local political nominations, Dahl finds that
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the number of persons who have participated in these decisive negotiations
 and influenced the outcome seems never to have been more than a half dozen
 in recent years
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (p.
 105).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we follow Dahl's approach and turn to what we call power
 
\emph on
foci
\emph default
, i.e., important political events and meetings as well as elites' appearances
 at them.
 The concept of foci is originally introduced by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Feld1981"

\end_inset

 to explore people's complex and embedded social circles in a community.
 A focus is usually defined as a social entity or event around which joint
 activities are organized (e.g., voluntary organizations, hangouts, and families).
 Since it is around these foci that individuals organize their social relations,
 we could learn essential features of their latent social space by studying
 the observable foci.
 Similarly, we argue that political events like ceremonies, policy meetings,
 and state visits can be treated as power foci, around which the ruling
 elite signal and manage their power relationships.
 For instance, an elite's presence in a policy meeting would suggest her
 or his involvement in the decision-making activities and thus convey valuable
 information about the actual processes of influence.
 As the ruling elite coordinate with each other via numerous such events,
 we could approximate their latent space of power-sharing by examining how
 these foci are interconnected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interlocking network of power foci reveals both positional and relational
 attributes about the ruling elite.
 It is positional in its ability to uncover individual elites' relative
 activeness and prominence in events where the actual processes of influence
 are at work.
 Moreover, the particular patterning of an elite's appearance defines her
 or his points of reference in the nebulous ruling group.
 This is consistent with Dahl's 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
key "Dahl1961"

\end_inset

 emphasis on observing decision-making activities.
 The interlocking foci network is also relational.
 Beyond specific events or individual elites, it shows how elites are connected
 via a variety of political events.
 Political elites intersect with each other within different political events,
 which are created based on shared policy problems or personal affinities.
 These links are not only able to channel important resources like information,
 but also can support mechanisms through which elites monitor and sanction
 each other.

Three 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Questions in a Latent Space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So how can we approximate the latent space of power-sharing from the interlockin
g foci network? In this study, we treat the foci network as a product of
 both stochastic and strategic factors.
 We further disaggregate the strategic factors into three questions — i.e.,
 who
\change_deleted -1949513326 1531919989
's
\change_inserted -1949513326 1531919989
 are
\change_unchanged
 in charge, who do I work with, and who are my friends, which correspond
 to the individual level characteristics, dyadic links, and latent affinities.
 Generally speaking, our approach can be summarized as follows: after controllin
g for random noise, powerful elites (i.e., who
\change_deleted -1949513326 1531921781
's
\change_inserted -1949513326 1531921781
 are
\change_unchanged
 in charge) are more likely to make appearances; elites who are in the same
 and related policy domains (i.e., who do I work with) are more likely to
 appear together; and finally elites who share latent affinities (i.e., who
 are my friends) are more likely to show up together.
 Together, the “three” who questions help us to approximate the latent space
 of elite power-sharing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first two who questions are quite consistent with the existing studies
 of elite politics.
 Similar to such positional studies as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Jaros2017"

\end_inset

, the question of who
\change_deleted -1949513326 1531921788
's
\change_inserted -1949513326 1531921788
 are
\change_unchanged
 in charge is focused on network dynamics that are stemmed from characteristics
 of individual elites.
 For instance, certain type of actors tend to be more active in initiating
 connections.
 In our case of elite politics, this suggests that powerful elites are more
 likely to preside and participate in important ceremonies and meetings.
 From the network analysis perspective, this greater tendency of certain
 actors to undertake certain behaviors is usually referred as the first-order
 dependency 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hoff2005,Kenny2006"

\end_inset

.
 In light of this, we expect, for example, Xi Jinping is simply going to
 make more appearances in aggregate than would a junior CCP elite.
 That is, if we compare two possible elites, a third person is 
\emph on
ceteris paribus
\emph default
 more likely to make a coappearance with Xi than with the junior CCP elite.
 On the other hand, the second who question examines if two elites attend
 the same event.
 Given its focus on the observable direct and dyadic links, this question
 follows the similar approach like 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Shih2010"

\end_inset

.
 The question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who do I work with
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 then highlights whether there is a direct coordination and collaboration
 between a pair of elites.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, what we emphasize in this study is that we cannot equate 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who do I work with
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who are my friends.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Simply using direct and dyadic links as a proxy of the latent affinity
 could lead to two types of errors, the incorrect rejection of a true friend
 and the false acceptance of a real enemy.
 A simply example of the first error is an indirect patronage relationship
 which involves a patron, a client, and a sub-client.
 If we rely solely on dyadic coappearance, we may end up in wrongly rejecting
 the relationship between the patron and sub-client.
 The second error could also occur in a three-party relationship when an
 elite share links with two rival patrons.
 In this case, we could run into either a false conclusion or no conclusion
 at all.
 Provided with these possible errors, some scholars have questioned the
 validity of factional studies based on dyadic analyses.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Miller2015d"

\end_inset

, a long-time observer of CCP elite politics, points to two problematic
 cases (i.e., Liu Yunshan and Li Yuanzhao), both of whom share strong ties
 with competing Jiang and Hu factions.
 Without a consistent criterion, she argues that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in the Xi era, faction-based analyses frequently rest on assertions of factional
 association that are tenuous, arbitrary, and at times peculiarly fungible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (p.
 7).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we argue that the above problems stem from the prevalence
 of indirect ties in elite politics, and one remedy is to examine the more
 complex and non-dyadic relationships like the aforementioned three-party
 transitivity problems.
 We thus turn to the question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who are my friends,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which is commonly accepted as the third order dependency in network analysis.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The second-order dependency usually refers to reciprocity, which does not
 apply to our case here.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Unlike first-order dependencies that are associated with attributes of
 individual actors, such high-dimensional dependencies usually arise from
 mechanisms like 
\change_inserted -1949513326 1531925116
latent 
\change_unchanged
homophily and stochastic equivalence.
 Homophily is the tendency for actors who share unobserved characteristics,
 for example their patron-client linkages, are more likely to be linked
 and make coappearances than actors that do not share those characteristics.
 Stochastic equivalence is the idea that actors might have similar roles
 in the network, and thus be more or less likely to make appearances with
 common coalitions.
 If two elites in China are both proteges of Xi Jinping, then they are both
 more likely to make co-appearances with Xi and his other proteges, and
 less likely to make co-appearances with Xi's rivals and his rivals' proteges.
 Therefore, a systematic study of such indirect ties helps us to understand
 the complex interdependencies between elites and thus provides a more accurate
 answer to the question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who are my friends.

To sum up, in this study we propose to conceptualize the elite power-sharing
 as a latent space, which allows us to synthesize both of its positional
 attributes and relational dynamics.
 We further argue that we can approximate this latent space by examining
 how power foci (i.e., political events and elites' appearance at them) are
 interconnected.
 Finally, we highlight the three who questions we need to address in this
 approximation.
 In the following parts, we introduce our empirical strategies and discuss
 how the approach could help shed light on the development of such informal
 institutions as the leading small groups.

\begin_layout Section
Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we rely on a unique database from the China Vitae project,
 which traces the public appearances of the CCP elites.
 We focus on the time period between January 1 2013 and January 1 2017,
 and there are about 10,000 appearance records of over 200 elites.
 This allows us to systematically examine the elite power-sharing in Xi's
 first term.
 Table 1 presents a small sample of our dataset and reports the date, the
 event, and elites in attendance.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Further information about the event locations, topics raised, and sources
 are also available.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 From Table 1, we can find our dataset captures how top CCP elites structured
 their power relationships via a variety of political activities, ranging
 from the civil-military unity meeting to the China-US summit.
 As argued above, these power foci constitute an interlocking network of
 events and elites, and Figure 1a shows how the six events in Table 1 could
 form a simple interlocking network.
 Since our main focus is elite relationship, we then extract the elite coappeara
nce network as shown in Figure 1b, and

 A quick examination shows a consistent annual pattern.
 There are much fewer elite appearances in February and August, and their
 activities peak in March and September.
 While the low points in springs are mainly due to the Chinese new year,
 those in August have a lot to do with the CCP's tradition of Beidaihe retreat

 In other words, for both Xi and Li, their coappearances account for similar
 weights in their total activities, though they were gradually departing
 away from each other.
 However, Xi-Zhang coappearances in Figure 2b show a different trend.
 Xi-Zhang coappearances were highly asymmetrical.
 The share of their coappearance is markedly more salient for Zhang

For 
\change_unchanged
the CCP elite coappearance network
\change_deleted -1949513326 1531929619

this

Thus if one were to simply utilize the number of direct ties as a measure

Latent Factor Analysis

\begin_layout Standard
To answer the question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who are my friends,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 we utilize a latent factor model (LFM) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hoff2005,Minhas2016a"

\end_inset

.
 LFM positions actors in a 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 dimensional latent vector space based on third order dependence patterns.
 In this space, actors whose vectors point in similar dimensions are more
 likely to share similar preferences and be members of the same latent coalition
s.
 The angles between these vectors then provides a measure of the extent
 to which the preferences and factional links are similar.
 Given its ability to capture latent affinities between interconnected actors,
 LFM has been used to infer state foreign policy preferences

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More formally, we conduct the analysis as follows.
 We treat our coappearance network as an 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix, where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 denotes the number of elites, and the matrix cell 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{ij}$
\end_inset

 represents the number of coappearances between elite 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and elite 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It should be noted that the coappearance data is symmetric and so 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{ij}=y_{ji}$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j$
\end_inset

.
 The approach we describe below has already been generalized to the case
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{ij}\neq y_{ji}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 To obtain the latent affinities between elites (i.e., a lower-dimension relationa
l measure), we then have an LFM as follows,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
Y & =f(\theta)\\
\theta & =\beta^{\top}\mathbf{X}+Z\\
Z & =M+E\\
M & =U\Lambda U^{\top}

where 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}\in{\rm I\!R^{k}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $k\times k$
\end_inset

 diagonal matrix.
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(.)$
\end_inset

 is a general link function corresponding to the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$

 We factorize the multiplicative effects into the product of two simpler

 Under this framework a vector of latent characteristics are thus estimated
 for each actor,

 Similarity in the latent factors between two actors,

 distances in this space
\change_inserted -1949513326 1531946173
 as a measure of latent affinities
\change_unchanged

 Rather, the important measure here is an actor's vector in this space,
 and the similarity between the vector of one actor and another.
 Comparing the similarity

\begin_inset Formula $\{i,j\}$

 A commonly used metric for this sort of problem 
\change_deleted -1949513326 1531946241
in the recommender system literature from computer science

is the cosine of the angle formed by the latent vectors of both actors.

\change_deleted -1949513326 1531946302
This can be calulated
\change_inserted -1949513326 1531946309

\change_unchanged
 in the following way, where

\begin_inset Formula $\text{Latent angle distance}_{ij}=\frac{u_{i}\cdot u_{j}}{||u_{i}||\cdot||u_{j}||}*(-1)$

 We refer to this distance metric as latent angle distance.
 
\change_deleted -1949513326 1531946592
Thus
\change_inserted -1949513326 1531946594
More concretely
\change_unchanged
, if the estimated latent vectors of two actors are in the same direction,
 they are apt to have made appearances with similar partners.
 We measure this by looking at the absolute distance of the angles created

In Figure 5, we can find CCP elites in our datasets fall into two clusters
 that are centered around Xi (i.e., the lower cluster) and Li (i.e., the upper
 cluster).
 To gain a better view about the relationship between key elites, we present
 the slices of Politburo members of the 18th and 19th Central Committee
 in Figure 6.
 First, consistent with Figure 5, the 18th Politburo members as shown in
 Figure 6a are also divided into the two clusters.
 More interesting, while the other three Vice Premiers (i.e., Liu Yandong,
 Wang Yang, and Ma Kai) are sided with Li, the first Vice Premier Zhang
 Gaoli is much closer to Xi.
 Second, in contrast to Figure 5 where more elites are found in the upper
 cluster, the majority of Politburo membersin Figure 6a are clustering around
 Xi.
 Particularly, the two military members, Xu Qiliang and Fan Changlong, are
 also in the lower cluster.
 This dominant Xi cluster is consistent with findings of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Third, Figure 6a also points an outlier elite in the upper left corner,
 Sun Zhengcai, who is a remote member of the Li cluster.
 However, Sun is almost diagonal to Xi, that is, a position farthest possible
 to Xi in the latent space.
 Our data point stop on January 1st 2017, and seven months later Sun was
 abruptly removed from his office as the party secretary of Chongqing.
 Finally, Figure 6b plots members of 19th Politburo who were elected over
 ten months after our last data point.
 It shows that how this approach is able to pick up potential changes in
 the Politburo.
 Together, the above findings suggest our approach suffice to meet satisfactory
 face validity.

All

 As an informal arrangement, LSGs is less restrained by formal regulations
 and can be strongly influenced by the elites who preside them.
 An LSG creates an enormous confluence of leadership over various state
 apparatuses within one small body.
 Recognizing this, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 argues that “at [the national] level, the [LSG] system is highly personal.
 ...
 There is ...
 a great deal of informal contact and maneuvering, with control over the
 various ‘leading groups’ an important prize in the political jockeying
 in the capital” (p.

 Huhe and Stepan's

 study of LSGs in Xi's first term also reveal that the appointments in CC
 and SC LSGs are highly skewed.
 While a majority of LSGs appointees are affiliated with only one LSG, a
 few elites concurrently sit in different LSGs.
 And this trend is particularly evident in CC LSGs.
 Figure 7 then shows how 242 CCP elites are linked via 19 CC LSGs and 16
 SC LSGs

Given that Chinese elites can be members of multiple LSGs, and that we have

 models are reported in Figure

\change_inserted -1949513326 1532007840
First, our baseline model (square) suggests that elites' total appearances
 matter in LSG appointments.
 Those 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who are in change
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 do attend more LSGs.
 Second, as shown in the coappearance model (circle), simply joining Xi
 in same political events (i.e., those 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who work with Xi
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) does not make CCP elites with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who work with Xi
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 more likely to be appointed in LSGs.
 This confirms our earlier discussion that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who do I work with
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 could run into two types of errors and mask the latent affinities between
 elites.
 Finally, in contrast to coappearances, 
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532007855
Interestingly, while coappearances with Xi do not have a robust relationship
 to placement on more LSGs
\change_unchanged
, the latent distance measure is significant and in the predicted direction
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532007873
.

\change_inserted -1949513326 1532007910
closer to

 Xi in the latent space
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532007946
 (i.e., those

\change_unchanged
 are seated on more

Leading Small Groups
\change_unchanged
.
 
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532008960
Moreover, when we take into account latent proximity to Xi, total appearances
 cease to matter, whereas they have the predicted positive effects in the
 other two models.
 
\change_unchanged
In Figure 7 we show the expected number of LSGs an elite with an average
 number of total appearances would be appointed to based on their latent
 distance from Xi, for that elite, moving from the closest angle distance
 observed to the furthest is associated with a drop in LSG appointment of
 about 1.5.

While our measure of Chinese latent proximity conforms to our theoretical
 expectations in terms of conventional statistical significance, an important
 test is whether it improves our ability to predict behavior
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532009054
s
\change_unchanged
 out of sample.
 To do this, we divide Chinese elites into 20 groups at random, and in each
 case predict how many LSGs an elite in that group will be appointed to
 using a model fit on the other 19 groups.
 We do this for each of our three main models
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532009292
 and report performance metrics in Table 2
\change_unchanged
.
 
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532009305
As you can see in Table 2, t
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532009320
We can find t
\change_unchanged
he model using latent angle difference significantly outperforms the models
 that only use total and coappearances, showing that this measure of latent
 distance helps us to predict promotion to the Leading Small Group.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted -1949513326 1532009626
Provided with the two clusters as shown in Figure 5, we further model LSG
 appointments 
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532009469
Additionally, we attempt to look at models 
\change_unchanged
based on distance
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532009476
, not to Xi Jinping, but
\change_unchanged
 to Li Keqiang
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532009531
, and the results are presented in Figure 10
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532009507
, to see how well individuals closer to Xi's rival perform in terms of appointme
nt to these groups
\change_unchanged
.
 We find that latent distance from Li
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532009648
, as depicted in Figure 8,
\change_unchanged
 is similarly associated with a lower probability of appointment to LSGs.
 However, combining the two distance measures results in a model that has
 ambiguous effects
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532009658
.
 
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532009686
, and this is in part because
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532009690
One reason is that
\change_unchanged
 for most members of the party, distance from Xi and Li are highly collinear.
 Importantly however, they differ for some individuals.
 
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532009977
However, a
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532009977
A
\change_unchanged
s depicted in Table 3, inclusion of latent distance to Li 
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532010153
Keqiang actually results in a 
\emph on
worse
\emph default
 performing model
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532010176
does not necessarily model performance
\change_unchanged
 out of sample.
 This implies that, for elites 
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532010206
where their
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532010207
whose
\change_unchanged
 distance
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532010209
s
\change_unchanged
 to Xi and Li diverge
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532010236
 (because they are between them in the latent angle space)
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532010096
,
\change_unchanged
 adding information about proximity to Li actually hurts the model's performance.

\change_deleted -1949513326 1532010124
 This might be because Xi has such a dominant hand in determining advancement
 in the party.

Finally, as emphasized by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, there are marked structural differences between CC LSGs and SC LSGs.
 While CC LSGs is highly centralized, reflecting Xi's power grip the party,
 SC LSGs are far more decentralized and driven more by specific needs of
 policy collaboration.
 
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532010944
Of course, not all LSGs are the same.
 There are groups at the State level and at the Central level.
 Based on institutional setup, while Xi has the final say on appointments
 to the Federal LSGs, Premiere Li Keqiang is responsible for the state level
 ones.
 Thus, t

 these differences, we run a bivariate probit analysis, which 
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532010979
simultaneously

estimates the likelihood that an elite will be appointed to any

Again in this analysis, latent distance from Xi has a consistent negative
 effect for both types of LSGs.
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532011362
From Table 4, we can find latent distance from Xi has a consistent and negative
 effect on the likelihood of appointment to CC LSGs, but there is no clear
 effect on SC LSGs.
 Conversely, distance from Li is associated with a lowed likelihood of appointme
nt to SC LSGs, but not the CC ones.
 The ability to distinguish between promotion to CC and SC LSGs renders
 more support for our approach to approximating the latent affinities between
 CCP elites.

Lacking strong and binding institutional rules, elite politics in authoritarian
 regimes tend to be opaque and volatile.
 This in turn introduces great difficulties for us to understand elite power-sha
ring where it is most needed.
 Particularly, as part of the global rise of strongman politics, Chinese
 politics under Xi has become
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532044022
Under Xi Jinping, Chinese politics has become
\change_unchanged
 less institutionalized and more personalist.
 
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532044743
The institutional limit on leadership terms has been elimitated, and Xi
 has centered power in his hands, and the hands of his allies.
 Given these developments, it is crucial to understand and measure factions
 and affinity within Chinese elites.
 
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532044807
To better understand these developments, 
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532044810
In this study, 
\change_unchanged
we propose a latent 
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532044823
network approach to explore the dynamic interactions of the CCP elites
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532044833
space framework
\change_unchanged
.
 
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532046150
We treat elite power-sharing as a latent space, and we argue that we can
 approximate this space by studying elites' appearances in various political
 events (i.e., power foci).
 Specifically, we highlight three crucial questions in this approximation,
 i.e., who are in charge, who do I work with, and who are my friends.
 
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532087483
We conceptualize public co-appearances as “foci,” around which various political
 activities are organized.
 Since elites’ engagement in these foci is highly selective, their co-appearance
s signal important information about elites’ collusion and cooptation.
 Based a unique dataset
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532087578
After applying the latent factor model to the appearance data of CCP elites,
 we are able to capture 
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532087672
, we aim to answer three critical questions — 1) who's in charge, (2) who
 do I work with, and (3) who are my friends — by examining 
\change_unchanged
elites’ total appearances, dyadic coappearances, and
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532087685
, most importantly,
\change_unchanged
 
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532087690
finally 
\change_unchanged
their latent network distance.
 
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532089521
We further examine how this approach could improve our understanding of
 such pivotal informal institutions as LSGs.
 
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532088354
We
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532088360
Our tests show that
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532088489
 find that 
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532089538
 the 
\change_unchanged
latent 
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532089559
network distance greatly improves our prediction of LSG appointments.
 It 
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532088625
proximity to Xi corresponds to policy prominence for Chinese elites.
 Most excitingly, we find that this latent measure
\change_unchanged
 significantly outperforms measures that simply look at individual power
 (who
\change_deleted -1949513326 1531921808
's
\change_inserted -1949513326 1532045883
 are
\change_unchanged
 in charge) and dyadic relationships (who do I work with).

\change_inserted -1949513326 1532090360
 As an additional demonstration of the measure's efficacy, we also find
 that it helps reveal CCP's more nuanced power-sharing arrangements.
 While the proximity to Xi helps to explain LSGs of the Central Committee,
 it is the latent distances from Li that better explain those of the State
 Council.

By introducing an integral framework, our study presents a possible avenue
 to synthesize different aspects of elite power-sharing in authoritarian
 regimes.
 It not only encompasses positional status of individual elites, but also
 incorporates how they are interrelated.
 This allows us to develop a systematic view about the inherent and uneasy
 tensions among authoritarian elites.
 As long noted by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Pye1995"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Chinese politics operated in an atmosphere of tension in which everyone
 sensed the need always to be careful and calculating about what was done
 or said
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (p.
 36).
 The three who questions proposed in this study then help highlight their
 key heuristics.
 Particularly, our emphasis on the question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who are our friends
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 suggests that we need to move beyond direct dyadic relationships and explore
 the more nuanced and subtle higher order dependencies.
\change_deleted -1949513326 1532090420
While we believe that this measure has aided us in our understanding and
 measurement of the Chinese political system, we can further improve our
 understanding in a few ways.
 First, this data can not only be compared to biographically and media measures
 of elite prominence, but in fact, the technique can incorporate these factors
 to gain a more nuanced understanding of elite networks and relationships.
 Secondly, we believe this technique can be expanded beyond China, to help
 us understand factional politics in other, even more opaque autocracies,
 such as North Korea or the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Studies of elite politics in authoritarian regimes have also been long plagued
 with data paucity.
 Our study points to an alternative data source, appearance data, that could
 complement existing data like media coverage and biographical archives.
 Such data not only is dynamic, it also sheds light on the actual realization
 of power relationship as emphasized by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Dahl1961"

\end_inset

.
 As a preliminary exploration, our study is inevitably limited, and more
 systematic are called for to improve collection and analysis of such data.
